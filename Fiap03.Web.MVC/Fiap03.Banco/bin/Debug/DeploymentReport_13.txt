     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[Carro].[Renavam] on table [dbo].[Carro] must be added, but the column has no default value and does
         not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must either:
         add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a
         deployment option.
       The type for column MarcaId in table [dbo].[Carro] is currently  VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL but is being changed to  INT NOT
         NULL. Data loss could occur.
